📖 Overview

This project simulates a real-world enterprise retail analytics platform built on Microsoft Azure using the Brazilian Olist E-Commerce dataset.

The solution demonstrates how raw multi-source e-commerce data can be ingested, transformed, modeled, and analyzed to produce business-ready insights for global retail organizations.

The architecture follows modern Medallion Architecture principles using:

Raw Zone (Bronze)
Cleaned/Validated Zone (Silver)
Curated Analytics Zone (Gold)

The project highlights:

Enterprise ETL orchestration
Scalable cloud data engineering
Data quality validation
Incremental data loading
Star schema dimensional modeling
KPI-driven analytics dashboards
Distributed data processing using PySpark
🎯 Business Problem
